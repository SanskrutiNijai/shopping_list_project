# Shopping List Project

A simple and responsive shopping list app built using modern JavaScript. This project helps users add, delete, and update a list of shopping items with persistent storage using localStorage.

It was developed as part of my journey to master DOM manipulation, event handling, and storage in JavaScript without any front-end frameworks.
